### What it threat modelling?

Threat modelling is a critical process that enables cybersecurity professionals to identify and evaluate potential risks and vulnerabilities in networks, applications, and systems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the importance of threat modelling in cybersecurity as well as the methodologies for applying it and real-world applications of the process.

Threat modelling is a proactive process that helps to reduce cybersecurity risks, protect sensitive information, prevent financial losses, and preserve a company's reputation. It also helps organizations to comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security.

To apply threat modelling, various methodologies can be used, such as STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege), DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability), and PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis). These methodologies help to identify and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities in an organization's assets.

Threat modelling can be applied to various aspects of cybersecurity, such as cloud computing, industrial control systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to evaluate the cybersecurity risks associated with IoT devices, which often lack standardization. Threat modelling can also evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with industrial control systems, which are critical infrastructure components that are often targeted by cyber attackers.

### What is the future of threat modelling?

Future developments in threat modelling are likely to focus on the integration of this process into the software development lifecycle, the development of new methodologies for evaluating cybersecurity risks, and the application of machine learning and other technologies to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of threat modelling.
